/**
 * If we do not have a specifically provided validation implementation we use that generic one.
 * <p>
 * - Most addresses use:
 * - Base58 (Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc.)
 * - Bech32 (starts with bc1, ltc1, etc.)
 * - Hex (e.g., Ethereum: 0x-prefixed 40 hex chars)
 * - Length Range: Usually 25â€“80 characters, depending on encoding.
 * - Alphanumeric (Ripple, Stellar, etc.)
 * <p>
 * We do not check:
 * - Checksum validation
 * - Prefix enforcement
 * - Network discrimination
